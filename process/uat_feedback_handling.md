# UAT Feedback Handling Process

## 1. Feedback Collection
- Gather all feedback from in-app forms, Slack channel, and surveys
- Consolidate feedback into a central tracking system (e.g., Jira)

## 2. Categorization
Categorize each piece of feedback:
- Bug: An error or flaw in the app
- Feature Request: Suggestion for new functionality
- Usability Issue: Difficulty in using existing features
- Performance Issue: Problems with app speed or responsiveness
- Other: Feedback that doesn't fit into above categories

## 3. Prioritization
Assign priority to each item:
- Critical: Must be addressed before release
- High: Should be addressed before release if possible
- Medium: Can be addressed in a near-future update
- Low: Nice-to-have, can be considered for future releases

## 4. Analysis
For each high-priority item:
- Investigate root cause
- Estimate effort required to address
- Assess potential impact on other features or systems

## 5. Action Planning
For bugs and critical issues:
- Assign to appropriate developer
- Set deadline for fix
- Plan for regression testing

For feature requests and usability issues:
- Discuss in product team meeting
- Decide whether to implement, defer, or decline
- If implementing, add to product roadmap

## 6. Implementation
- Develop fixes or new features as decided
- Conduct thorough testing of changes
- Update documentation as necessary

## 7. Verification
- Have original reporter verify that their feedback has been addressed
- For bugs, ensure fix resolves the issue without introducing new problems
- For new features or usability improvements, confirm they meet user expectations

## 8. Communication
- Regularly update beta testers on progress
- Prepare release notes detailing addressed feedback
- Thank users for their valuable input

## 9. Reflection
- Conduct a retrospective on the UAT process
- Identify areas for improvement in the app development lifecycle
- Update development practices based on lessons learned

## 10. Ongoing Monitoring
- Continue to gather feedback after public release
- Establish a process for ongoing user feedback collection and handling
