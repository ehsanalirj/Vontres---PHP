# Vontres AI System Architecture

## Overview
Vontres AI is a scalable, AI-powered call center system designed to handle millions of users and thousands of simultaneous calls. The system is built using a microservices architecture, allowing for independent scaling of different components.

## Key Components

### 1. Call Handling Service
- Responsible for managing incoming and outgoing calls
- Uses Twilio for VoIP functionality
- Implements load balancing for handling high call volumes

### 2. AI Service
- Provides real-time AI assistance during calls
- Implements sentiment analysis, call routing, and script suggestions
- Uses OpenAI's GPT models for natural language processing

### 3. Analytics Service
- Processes call data in real-time
- Generates insights and reports
- Uses ClickHouse for high-performance analytics

### 4. User Management Service
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Manages user roles and permissions

### 5. Distributed Cache
- Uses Redis Cluster for caching frequently accessed data
- Improves system performance and reduces database load

### 6. Message Queue
- Uses Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between services
- Ensures system reliability and scalability

## Data Flow
1. Incoming call received by Call Handling Service
2. Call data sent to AI Service for analysis and routing
3. Call routed to appropriate agent
4. Real-time call data streamed to Analytics Service
5. AI Service provides real-time suggestions to agent
6. Call details stored in database and cache updated

## Scaling Strategy
- Each service is containerized and deployed on Kubernetes
- Horizontal scaling based on CPU and memory usage
- Use of CDN for static content delivery

## Security Measures
- JWT for authentication
- HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Monitoring and Logging
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting

## Disaster Recovery
- Regular automated backups
- Multi-region deployment for high availability
- Automated failover procedures
